# CNV calling pipeline

The CNV calling pipeline is based on the package "ExomeDepth" (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ExomeDepth/index.html). 


**The original package uses hg19 but the WES pipeline (Drazer-lab WES_pipeline repository) aligns sequences to hg38 so make sure you use the hg38 files in this folder- not the default hg19 files and data frames.**
