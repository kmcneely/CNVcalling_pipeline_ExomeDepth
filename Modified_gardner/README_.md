# CNV calling pipeline

CNV calling pipeline based on package "ExomeDepth"

**Make sure you know what genome build your sequences were aligned to and use the appropriate references and data frames. ExomeDepth comes with data frames for hg19 and this folder has an "exons_hg38.Rda" data frame for hg38-aligned sequences.**
